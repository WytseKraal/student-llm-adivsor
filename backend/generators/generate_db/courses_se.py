    "NAME": "Requirements Engineering",
    "DESCRIPTION": "At the heart of Requirements Engineering is making careful decisions about what system to construct. To understand what decisions to make, we must gather and structure knowledge about the domain and feasibility. Humans are not infallible truth-finding machines, and our decision-making is often flawed. This interactive course explores requirements engineering approaches and pitfalls by discussing real-life cases. Students will explore psychological and philosophical sources and practice extensively, with a primary focus on interviewing techniques.",
