#### GitHub
Github renders every Mermaid code-block inside of Markdown files, issues, and PR comments automatically into an iframe, which works fantastic plus you have version control.

#### VS-Code
If you are using VS Code like me, I recommend installing the [Mermaid Markdown plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid). That way Mermaid code-blocks will be rendered in the preview window.

## Userstory:
